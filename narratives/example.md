abstract: "Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a salmon disease caused by ISA virus (ISAV), a virus within the Orthomyxoviridae family. The first record of the disease was first reported in Norway xx years ago, and has since been reported in several other countries. In order to get an overview over the existing published sequences and datasets, we performed a meta-analysis using Nextstrain on historical ISAV sequence data deposited in NCBI and the associated published metadata. In brief the analysis supports previously published reports and recapitulates geographical spread patterns as well as estimates of time of divergence and substitution rates for the virus."

# [Emergence of ISAV](http://localhost:4000/isav/segm6?c=num_date&r=region)

## When was the first record of ISAV found
published records suggests the first occurance of ISAV in Norway.

## How did the virus spread from its origin
Phylogenetic and geographical distribution of sampled and sequenced virus strains suggests as aslso previous publications indicate that the virus spread from Norway and caused a viral outbreak in Chile.

# [Substitution Rate Estimates](http://localhost:4000/isav/segm6?d=tree&l=clock&p=full&r=region)

### Rate estimate of ***0.46 substitutions per year*** corresponds to approximately ***3.7 x 10-4 substitutions/per-site/year***, which is in good agreement the published estimate of ***3.5 x 10-4 substitutions/per-site/year*** (larre, H., Nylund, A., Karlsen, M. et al. Evolution of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISA virus). Arch Virol 157, 2309â€“2326 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1438-0)

Clade specific variants are distributed unevenly geograpically.
