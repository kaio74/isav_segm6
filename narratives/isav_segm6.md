# [Substitution Rate Estimates](http://localhost:4000/isav/segm6?d=tree&l=clock&p=full&r=region)

### Rate estimate of ***0.46 substitutions per year*** corresponds to approximately ***3.7 x 10-4 substitutions/per-site/year***, which is in good agreement the published estimate of ***3.5 x 10-4 substitutions/per-site/year*** (larre, H., Nylund, A., Karlsen, M. et al. Evolution of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISA virus). Arch Virol 157, 2309â€“2326 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1438-0)

Distribution of ISAV outbreaks relative to farmed, broodfish or wild fish stocks.

Clade specific variants are distributed unevenly geograpically.
