# [Four Distinct Clades](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=clade_membership&l=unrooted&p=grid)

Crispell et al. identified four regionally localized clades formed by the samples. 

<br>Clade 2 (red) is mostly found on the North Island, but has a distinct foci of infection on the South Island.

<br>Clade 1 (blue) is most prevalent and is primarily on the South Island.

<br>Clade 3 (yellow) is mostly found in the southwest of the South Island, and Clade 4 (green) is found in a small area in the south of the Sound Island.

# [Substitution Rate Estimates](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=clade_membership&l=clock&p=grid)

Crispell et al. estimated the mutation rate at 0.53 events per genome per year, which
translates to ~1.2x10^-7 subs/site/year - very similar to the estimate obtained here. 

# [Date Estimates](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=clade_membership&l=rect&p=grid)

Crispell et al. estimate the root of Clade 1 at 1859 (95% CI 1525-1936). 
<br>Here, the root of Clade 1 is estimated similarly, at 1833 (1807-1837).
As found by Crispell et al., the structure of Clade 1 does not seem to indicate a single introduction event. 

<br>The other three clades have more recent root estimates, with Clade 2 estimated at 1855, and clades 3 and 4 being significantly more recent at 1944 and 1929, respectively.

# [Zooming in on a Clade](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=clade_membership&clade=Clade_1&l=rect&p=grid)

It's possible to zoom in on a clade to say something about it specifically. <br><br> Here we zoom in on Clade 1.

# [Host trait analysis](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=host_cat&l=rect&p=grid&gmax=4500000&gmin=0)

Crispell et al. concluded that the dominant direction of transmission was from wildlife to cattle, a conclusion supported by the ancestral traits analysis here. 
Clades 1, 2, and 3 all have estimates of a wildlife origin over 97%.  

<br>Note that colouring has changed to 'host category'. You can click the downward-chevron to expand the legend if it's hidden. You can mouse over branches to see the confidence of the host trait.

# [Host origin](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=host&l=rect&p=grid&gmax=4256665&gmin=4234541)

One can examine the role of the non-native brushtail possum in linking transmission of M. bovis between other hosts. 

<br>Also, we zoomed in on the genome to highlight changes in some genes, to show this is possible.

# [esxQ Gene](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/emmahodcroft/tb/crispell?c=gt-esxQ_102&l=rect&p=grid)

We can also zoom in on genes and nucleotide/amino-acid positions while colouring the tree by them.

<br>Here is an interesting reoccuring mutation in the esxQ gene at site 102.
